<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
    All new PHP files MUST have strict type mode enabled by starting with declare(strict_types=1);.
    All updated PHP files SHOULD have strict type mode enabled. PHP interfaces MAY have this declaration.
</p>
<p>
    PHP code becomes more robust when type hinting (argument types, return types) are added.
    With the declare(strict_types=1) added, there is less chance for bugs that related to type casting.
