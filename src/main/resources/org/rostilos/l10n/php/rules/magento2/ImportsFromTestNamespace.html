<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Sometimes IDE imports the namespace with Test automatically for return data type like string, float etc or any other means.</p>

<h3>Reasoning</h3>
<p>
    Time to time we're getting issue with running tests on PRs in magento/magento2 repository because
    someone imported \Magento\Tests\NamingConvention\true\string by mistake. As result - we have "No build reports available"
    for "Database Compare build", "Functional Tests build",
    "Sample Data Tests build" while Static tests are shown as "failing" but in results - we don't really have reason
</p>

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre data-diff-id="2" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
namespace Magento\Catalog\Model;

use Magento\Tests\Framework\Fixture\Product; // Noncompliant - importing from test namespace
use Magento\Tests\Unit\Helper\ObjectManager; // Noncompliant - importing from test namespace

class ProductService
{
    ...
}
</pre>

<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
namespace Magento\Catalog\Model;

use Magento\Catalog\Api\Data\ProductInterface;
use Magento\Catalog\Api\ProductRepositoryInterface;

class ProductService
{
    ...
}
</pre>
