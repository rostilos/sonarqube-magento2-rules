<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>

<p>This rule detects when a variable previously set to <code>false</code> is later accessed as an array. In PHP 8.1 and later, this automatic conversion (autovivification) is deprecated and will generate warnings.</p>

<h3>Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Starting with PHP 8.1, automatic conversion of <code>false</code> to array when accessing it with array syntax is deprecated. This can lead to several issues:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Deprecation warnings in production environments</li>
    <li>Code that will break in future PHP versions</li>
    <li>Logical errors where arrays are created unexpectedly</li>
    <li>Hard-to-track bugs due to implicit type conversion</li>
</ul>

<h3>Noncompliant Code Example</h3>
<pre data-diff-id="2" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
function processSomething() {
    $data = false;
    $data['key'] = 'value'; // Noncompliant - $data will be automatically converted from false to array

    return $data;
}

function processItems($items) {
    $result = false;  // Set to false initially

    foreach ($items as $item) {
        $result[] = $item->getValue(); // Noncompliant - implicit conversion from false to array
    }

    return $result;
}
</pre>

<h3>Compliant Solution</h3>
<pre>
function processSomething() {
    $data = [];
    $data['key'] = 'value'; // Compliant - $data is already an array

    return $data;
}

function processItems($items) {
    $result = [];

    foreach ($items as $item) {
        $result[] = $item->getValue(); // Compliant - $result is already an array
    }

    return $result ?: false;
}

function conditionalProcess($condition) {
    $data = $condition ? [] : null;

    if ($condition) {
        $data['key'] = 'value'; // Only access as array when we know it's an array
    }

    return $data;
}
</pre>

<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>This rule specifically targets variables that are first assigned <code>false</code> and then later accessed as arrays. It does not warn about:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Variables initialized with <code>null</code> (although similar autovivification issues exist)</li>
    <li>Variables initialized with <code>[]</code> (empty array)</li>
    <li>Variables properly checked for their type before array access</li>
</ul>
