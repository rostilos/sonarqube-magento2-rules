<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
    Proxies and interceptors MUST NEVER be explicitly requested in constructors.
</p>
<p>
    Magento 2 automatically generates proxy and interceptor classes for dependency injection.
    Developers should never explicitly request these in constructors, as it can break dependency management and lead to unintended behavior.
</p>

<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre data-diff-id="2" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
class MyClass {
    public function __construct(\Magento\Catalog\Model\Product\Interceptor $product) {
        // Noncompliant: directly requesting an Interceptor
    }
}
</pre>

<pre data-diff-id="2" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
class MyClass {
    public function __construct(\Magento\Customer\Model\ResourceModel\CustomerRepositoryProxy $customerRepo) {
        // Noncompliant: Directly requesting a Proxy
    }
}
 </pre>


<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
class MyClass {
    public function __construct(\Magento\Customer\Model\ResourceModel\CustomerRepository $product) { // Compliant
        ...
    }
}
</pre>
