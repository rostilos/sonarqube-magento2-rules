<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>
    Follow <a href="https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/php/development/security/cross-site-scripting/" target="_blank">
    XSS prevention strategies</a> guidelines for escaping output.
</p>
<p>
    Output processing involves sanitizing strings that may have come from external data sources before using it to render views.
    It is the main method of protecting your extension from XSS attacks.</p>
<p>The general rule is: Do not trust dynamic values.</p>

<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre data-diff-id="2" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
&lt;?= __('Text to translate') ?&gt;
...
&lt;?php echo $customer->getName() ?&gt;
...
&lt;div data-bind='settings: &lt;?= $myJson ?&gt;'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
&lt;?= $escaper->escapeHtml(__('Text to translate')) ?&gt;
...
&lt;?php echo $escaper->escapeHtml($customer->getName()) ?&gt;
...
&lt;div data-bind='settings: &lt;?= $escaper->escapeHtmlAttr($myJson) ?&gt;'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>


<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>/* @noEscape */ before output. Output does not require escaping. Test is green.</li>
    <li>/* @escapeNotVerified */ before output. Output escaping is not checked and should be verified. Test is green.</li>
    <li>Methods which contain "html" in their names (for example echo $object->{suffix}Html{postfix}()).
        Data is ready for the HTML output. Test is green.
    </li>
    <li>
        AbstractBlock methods escapeHtml, escapeHtmlAttr, escapeUrl, escapeJs are allowed. Test is green.
    </li>
    <li>Type casting and php function count() are allowed (for example echo (int)$var, (bool)$var, count($var)). Test is green.</li>
    <li>Primitives (for example echo 'some text', 1, 1.30). Test is green.</li>
</ul>
