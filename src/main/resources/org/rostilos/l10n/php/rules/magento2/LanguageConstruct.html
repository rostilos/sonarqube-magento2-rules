<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>

<p>This rule detects the use of discouraged PHP language constructs that should be avoided in Magento 2 code:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>echo</code> and <code>print</code>: Direct output to the browser is discouraged in Magento 2. Output should be controlled through the proper templating system.</li>
    <li>Backticks (<code>`</code>): Backtick usage for command execution is a security risk and should be avoided.</li>
</ul>

<pre data-diff-id="2" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
function someFunction() {
    echo "Some output";
    print "More output";
    $output = `ls -la`;
}
</pre>
