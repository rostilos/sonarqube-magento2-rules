<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Modifying function arguments can lead to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Unexpected behavior when the modified argument is used later in the calling code</li>
    <li>Decreased code readability and maintainability</li>
    <li>Difficulty in reasoning about the function's behavior</li>
    <li>Potential side effects in the calling code</li>
</ul>

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre data-diff-id="2" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
public function arrayFunction(array $items)
{
    $items[] = 'new item'; // Noncompliant: Function argument "$items" should not be modified.
    $items['key'] = 'value'; // Noncompliant: Function argument "$items" should not be modified.

    foreach ($items as &$item) { // Using reference in foreach is also modifying the argument
        $item = strtoupper($item); //  Noncompliant This modifies $items indirectly
    }

    return $items;
}
</pre>

<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
function processData($data) {
  $processedData = trim($data); // Compliant - using a local variable
  return $processedData;
}
</pre>

<h2>Why is this important?</h2>


<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>
    There are some cases where modifying function arguments might be acceptable, particularly for
    performance reasons with large data structures. However, in such cases, it should be clearly
    documented that the function modifies its arguments.
