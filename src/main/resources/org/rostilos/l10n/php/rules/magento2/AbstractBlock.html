<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>The rule aims to detect legacy practices for block classes and their methods</p>

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre data-diff-id="2" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
$block->getChildHtml('block_name', true, true); // Noncompliant {{3rd parameter is not needed anymore for getChildHtml()}}
$block->getChildChildHtml('a', 'b', 'c', 'd'); // Noncompliant {{4th parameter is not needed anymore for getChildChildHtml()}}
</pre>

<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
$block->getChildHtml('block_name', true); //Compliant
$block->getChildChildHtml('a', 'b', 'c'); //Compliant
</pre>

<h2>Methods to check</h2>
<ul>
    <li><code>getChildHtml</code></li>
    <li><code>getChildChildHtml</code></li>
</ul>
